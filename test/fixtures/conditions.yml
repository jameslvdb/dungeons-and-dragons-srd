exhaustion:
  name: exhaustion
  description: Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.<br><h3></h3><table><tr><th>Level</th><th>Effect</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Disadvantage on ability checks</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Speed halved</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Hit point maximum halved</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Speed reduced to 0</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Death</td></tr></table>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.<br>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.<br>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.<br>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1.<br>
